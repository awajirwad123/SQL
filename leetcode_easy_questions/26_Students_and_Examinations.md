**Examinations Table:**
| student_id | subject_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |

| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |

**Expected Output:**
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |

**Explanation:**
- Alice (student_id=1) attended Math 3 times, Physics 2 times, Programming 1 time
- Bob (student_id=2) attended Math 1 time, Programming 1 time, Physics 0 times
- Alex (student_id=6) didn't attend any exams (0 for all subjects)
- John (student_id=13) attended each subject 1 time

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Need all combinations of students and subjects (Cartesian product)
- Count attendance for each student-subject combination
- Include students who didn't attend any exams (zeros)
- Sort by student_id and subject_name

### 2. **Key Insights**
- CROSS JOIN to get all student-subject combinations
- LEFT JOIN to preserve combinations with zero attendance
- COUNT with proper grouping
- Handle NULL values from LEFT JOIN

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This requires a complete matrix of students √ó subjects"
- "Need CROSS JOIN to generate all possible combinations"
- "LEFT JOIN ensures we capture zero attendance"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Create Student-Subject Matrix
```sql
-- CROSS JOIN Students and Subjects
-- This creates all possible student-subject combinations
```

### Step 2: Left Join with Examinations
```sql
-- LEFT JOIN with Examinations table
-- Preserves all combinations, even with no exam attendance
```

### Step 3: Count Attendances
```sql
-- COUNT(e.student_id) counts actual exam records
-- NULL values from LEFT JOIN are not counted
```

### Step 4: Sort Results
```sql
-- ORDER BY student_id, subject_name
-- Ensure consistent result ordering
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: CROSS JOIN with LEFT JOIN**
```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.student_id) as attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e ON s.student_id = e.student_id 
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using CTE for Clarity**
```sql
WITH student_subject_matrix AS (
    SELECT 
        s.student_id,
        s.student_name,
        sub.subject_name
    FROM Students s
    CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
)
SELECT 
    ssm.student_id,
    ssm.student_name,
    ssm.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.student_id) as attended_exams
FROM student_subject_matrix ssm
LEFT JOIN Examinations e ON ssm.student_id = e.student_id 
    AND ssm.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY ssm.student_id, ssm.student_name, ssm.subject_name
ORDER BY ssm.student_id, ssm.subject_name;
```

**Solution 3: With Detailed Analytics**
```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    sub.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.student_id) as attended_exams,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(e.student_id) = 0 THEN 'No Attendance'
        WHEN COUNT(e.student_id) = 1 THEN 'Low Attendance'
        WHEN COUNT(e.student_id) <= 3 THEN 'Moderate Attendance'
        ELSE 'High Attendance'
    END as attendance_category,
    ROUND(COUNT(e.student_id) * 100.0 / (
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Examinations e2 WHERE e2.subject_name = sub.subject_name
    ), 2) as subject_attendance_percentage
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e ON s.student_id = e.student_id 
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

**Solution 4: Including Overall Statistics**
```sql
WITH base_results AS (
    SELECT

    GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
),
student_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        student_id,
        SUM(attended_exams) as total_exams_attended,
        AVG(attended_exams) as avg_exams_per_subject,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN attended_exams > 0 THEN 1 END) as subjects_with_attendance
    FROM base_results
    GROUP BY student_id
),
subject_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        subject_name,
        SUM(attended_exams) as total_subject_attendance,
        AVG(attended_exams) as avg_attendance_per_student,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN attended_exams > 0 THEN 1 END) as students_with_attendance
    FROM base_results
    GROUP BY subject_name
)
SELECT 
    br.student_id,
    br.student_name,
    br.subject_name,
    br.attended_exams,
    st.total_exams_attended,
    ROUND(st.avg_exams_per_subject, 2) as student_avg_per_subject,
    sbt.total_subject_attendance,
    ROUND(sbt.avg_attendance_per_student, 2) as subject_avg_per_student
FROM base_results br
JOIN student_totals st ON br.student_id = st.student_id
JOIN subject_totals sbt ON br.subject_name = sbt.subject_name
ORDER BY br.student_id, br.subject_name;
```

**Solution 5: Performance Optimized Version**
```sql
-- For large datasets, pre-aggregate examinations
WITH exam_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        student_id,
        subject_name,
        COUNT(*) as attended_exams
    FROM Examinations
    GROUP BY student_id, subject_name
)
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,

## üîó Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#1068 - Product Sales Analysis I** (Basic JOIN operations)
2. **#1581 - Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions** (LEFT JOIN with counting)
3. **#1693 - Daily Leads and Partners** (GROUP BY with counting)
4. **#1148 - Article Views I** (DISTINCT with filtering)
5. **#1378 - Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier** (JOIN operations)

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **CROSS JOIN**: Creating all possible combinations
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Preserving all combinations including zeros
3. **COUNT with JOIN**: Proper aggregation with NULL handling
4. **Matrix Generation**: Student √ó Subject complete coverage

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Clarify requirements**: "Should I include students who never attended any exams?"
2. **Explain CROSS JOIN**: "This creates the complete student-subject matrix"
3. **Handle zeros properly**: "LEFT JOIN ensures we capture zero attendance"
4. **Discuss performance**: "CROSS JOIN can be expensive with large tables"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- CROSS JOIN for complete combinations
- LEFT JOIN to preserve all combinations
- COUNT with NULL handling from outer joins
- GROUP BY with multiple columns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Using INNER JOIN** (missing zero attendance records)
2. **Wrong COUNT function** (using COUNT(*) instead of COUNT(column))
3. **Missing ORDER BY** (inconsistent result ordering)
4. **Performance issues** (not optimizing CROSS JOIN)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- CROSS JOIN can be expensive for large tables
- Index on (student_id, subject_name) for join optimization
- Consider materialized views for frequently accessed combinations
- Pre-aggregate when dealing with large examination datasets

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Customer Obsession**: Complete academic tracking improves student outcomes
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Comprehensive attendance analytics guide academic policies
- **Operational Excellence**: Systematic tracking of all student-subject combinations
- **Innovation**: Advanced analytics for personalized academic interventions

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Include exam scores and calculate averages**
2. **Add time-based analysis (monthly/quarterly attendance)**
3. **Find students with perfect attendance**
4. **Calculate attendance rates by demographics**

Remember: Complete matrix reporting is crucial for Amazon's educational technology platforms, learning management systems, certification tracking, and comprehensive student analytics across diverse learning programs!
