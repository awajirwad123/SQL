# LeetCode Easy #1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the **ids** of products that are both **low fat** and **recyclable**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Products Table:**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
```
- product_id is the primary key for this table.
- low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
- recyclable is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

## üìä Sample Data

**Products Table:**
| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

**Expected Output:**
| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

**Explanation:**
Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat (Y) and recyclable (Y).

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Filter products with TWO conditions simultaneously
- Both low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
- Simple WHERE clause with multiple conditions
- Return only product_id column

### 2. **Key Insights**
- Use AND operator to combine conditions
- ENUM values are string literals, need quotes
- Both conditions must be true (intersection, not union)
- Basic filtering operation

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "Need both conditions to be true, so use AND operator"
- "ENUM values are stored as strings, so compare with 'Y'"
- "Simple filtering problem, straightforward WHERE clause"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Identify Required Columns
```sql
-- Need only product_id in result
SELECT product_id
```

### Step 2: Apply First Condition
```sql
-- Filter for low fat products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y'
```

### Step 3: Apply Second Condition
```sql
-- Also filter for recyclable products
AND recyclable = 'Y'
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Basic AND Condition**
```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' 
  AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using IN Operator (Overkill but Valid)**
```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats IN ('Y')
  AND recyclable IN ('Y');
```

**Solution 3: With Explicit Boolean Logic**
```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE (low_fats = 'Y')
  AND (recyclable = 'Y');
```

**Solution 4: Using CASE for Demonstration**
```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE CASE WHEN low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END = 1;
```

## üîó Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#1683 - Invalid Tweets** (Simple WHERE clause filtering)
2. **#1729 - Find Followers Count** (Basic filtering and aggregation)
3. **#1978 - Employees Whose Manager Left the Company** (Multiple condition filtering)
4. **#1789 - Primary Department for Each Employee** (Filtering with employee data)
5. **#1795 - Rearrange Products Table** (Product data manipulation)

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **AND Operator**: Both conditions must be true simultaneously
2. **ENUM Comparison**: Compare ENUM values with string literals ('Y', 'N')
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filter rows based on multiple column conditions
4. **Simple Filtering**: Basic boolean logic for data filtering

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Explain boolean logic**: "Need both conditions true, so use AND operator"
2. **Discuss ENUM handling**: "ENUM values stored as strings, compare with 'Y'"
3. **Address business requirements**: "Both sustainability criteria must be met"
4. **Consider scalability**: "Simple filter easily handles large product catalogs"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- Multiple WHERE conditions with AND operator
- ENUM value comparison with string literals
- Single table filtering operations
- Boolean logic in SQL conditions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Using OR instead of AND** (would include products with only one property)
2. **Forgetting quotes around ENUM values** ('Y' not Y)
3. **Case sensitivity** (ensuring correct 'Y' vs 'y')
4. **Null handling** (though not applicable in this problem)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- INDEX on low_fats for fast filtering
- INDEX on recyclable for efficient lookups
- Composite index on (low_fats, recyclable) for optimal performance
- Simple conditions are highly optimizable

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Customer Obsession**: Focus on products that meet health and environmental customer needs
- **Ownership**: Take responsibility for promoting sustainable and healthy products
- **Think Big**: Scale sustainable product offerings across Amazon's platform
- **Deliver Results**: Efficiently identify products that meet multiple customer criteria

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Find products that are either low fat OR recyclable (not both)**
2. **Count total products by sustainability category**
3. **Calculate percentage of products that meet both criteria**
4. **Find products that need improvement (neither criteria met)**

Remember: Simple filtering operations like this form the foundation for complex product analytics that power Amazon's massive e-commerce platform and sustainability initiatives!
