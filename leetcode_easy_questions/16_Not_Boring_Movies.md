# LeetCode Easy #620: Not Boring Movies

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to report all movies with an **odd-numbered ID** and a **description that is not "boring"**.

Return the result table **ordered by rating in descending order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Cinema Table:**
```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
```
- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
- `rating` is a 2-decimal places float in the range [0, 10]

## üìä Sample Data

**Cinema Table:**
| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

**Expected Output:**
| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

**Explanation:** 
- Movies with odd IDs: 1, 3, 5
- Movies that are not "boring": 1, 5 (ID 3 has description "boring")
- Result ordered by rating descending: 5 (9.1), then 1 (8.9)

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Two filtering conditions: odd ID AND description != "boring"
- Simple WHERE clause with multiple conditions
- ORDER BY rating DESC for final sorting
- Straightforward filtering problem

### 2. **Key Insights**
- Use MOD function or % operator to check for odd numbers
- String comparison for filtering out "boring" description
- Combine conditions with AND operator
- Standard ORDER BY for sorting

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This is a basic filtering problem with two conditions"
- "I need to check if ID is odd using modulo operation"
- "String filtering requires exact match for 'boring'"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Filter Odd IDs
```sql
-- Use MOD(id, 2) = 1 or id % 2 = 1 to check odd numbers
```

### Step 2: Filter Non-Boring Movies
```sql
-- Use description != 'boring' or description <> 'boring'
```

### Step 3: Combine and Sort
```sql
-- Combine conditions with AND
-- ORDER BY rating DESC for highest rating first
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Using MOD Function**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1 
  AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using % Operator**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 
  AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Solution 3: Using NOT LIKE**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1 
  AND description NOT LIKE 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Solution 4: Explicit Odd Check**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE (id - 1) % 2 = 0  -- Alternative odd check
  AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Solution 5: With Case-Insensitive Check**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1 
  AND LOWER(description) != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **MOD/% Operator**: Checking for odd/even numbers
2. **String Filtering**: Exact string matching for exclusions
3. **Multiple Conditions**: Combining filters with AND/OR
4. **ORDER BY**: Sorting results by numerical columns

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Clarify requirements**: "Should the comparison be case-sensitive?"
2. **Discuss performance**: "Indexing on filtered columns improves performance"
3. **Consider edge cases**: "What about NULL descriptions or invalid ratings?"
4. **Think business context**: "This helps curate quality content for users"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- MOD(column, 2) = 1 for odd number checking
- String comparison with != or <> operators
- Multiple WHERE conditions with AND
- ORDER BY with DESC for highest-first sorting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Using wrong modulo logic** (MOD(id, 2) = 0 for odd instead of = 1)
2. **Case sensitivity issues** (not considering UPPER/LOWER case variations)
3. **Missing ORDER BY** when specific sorting is required
4. **Performance issues** (not indexing frequently filtered columns)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- Index on id column for efficient modulo operations
- Index on description for string filtering
- Composite index on (id, description, rating) for optimal performance
- Consider query execution order for large datasets

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Customer Obsession**: Filtering quality content for better user experience
- **Operational Excellence**: Efficient content curation algorithms

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Find movies with even IDs and rating above 8.0**
2. **Count movies by description and rating category**
3. **Find the highest-rated movie in each description category**
4. **Calculate average rating excluding "boring" movies**
