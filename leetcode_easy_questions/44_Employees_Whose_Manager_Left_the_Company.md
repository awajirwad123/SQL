# LeetCode Easy #1978: Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the **employees** whose **salary is less than $30000** and whose **manager left the company**. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table **ordered by employee_id**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Employees Table:**
```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
```
- employee_id is the primary key for this table.
- This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the id of their manager.
- Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null).

## üìä Sample Data

**Employees Table:**
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

**Expected Output:**
| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |

**Explanation:**
- Employee 11 (Joziah) has salary 28485 (< 30000) and manager_id 6, but no employee with id 6 exists in the table
- Employee 1 (Kalel) has salary 21241 (< 30000) and manager_id 11, but employee 11 exists in the table
- Other employees either have salary >= 30000 or no manager_id or their manager exists

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Find employees with salary < 30000 AND manager left company
- Manager "left" means manager_id points to non-existent employee
- Use LEFT JOIN or NOT EXISTS to detect missing managers
- Order result by employee_id

### 2. **Key Insights**
- Two conditions: salary < 30000 AND manager not in table
- Manager_id IS NOT NULL (employees without managers don't count)
- LEFT JOIN with NULL check or NOT EXISTS subquery
- Missing manager means their record was deleted

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "Need both salary condition AND missing manager condition"
- "Use LEFT JOIN to find managers that don't exist in employee table"
- "Exclude employees with NULL manager_id - they never had managers"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Filter by Salary
```sql
-- First condition: salary < 30000
WHERE salary < 30000
```

### Step 2: Check for Manager Existence
```sql
-- Use LEFT JOIN to find missing managers
LEFT JOIN Employees manager ON e.manager_id = manager.employee_id
WHERE manager.employee_id IS NULL
```

### Step 3: Exclude NULL Manager_ID
```sql
-- Only consider employees who had managers
AND e.manager_id IS NOT NULL
```

### Step 4: Order Results
```sql
-- Order by employee_id as requested
ORDER BY employee_id
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: LEFT JOIN Approach**
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employees manager ON e.manager_id = manager.employee_id
WHERE e.salary < 30000
  AND e.manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND manager.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: NOT EXISTS Subquery**
```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees e
WHERE salary < 30000
  AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM Employees m 
      WHERE m.employee_id = e.manager_id
  )
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

**Solution 3: NOT IN Approach (with NULL handling)**
```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000
  AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND manager_id NOT IN (
      SELECT employee_id 
      FROM Employees 
      WHERE employee_id IS NOT NULL
  )
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

**Solution 4: Window Function Analysis**
```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id,
        e.salary,
        e.manager_id,
        m.employee_id as manager_exists
    FROM Employees e
    LEFT JOIN Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
) emp_analysis
WHERE salary < 30000
  AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND manager_exists IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

## üîó Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#1731 - The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee** (Employee hierarchy relationships)
2. **#1789 - Primary Department for Each Employee** (Employee organizational structure)
3. **#1741 - Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee** (Employee performance analysis)
4. **#1729 - Find Followers Count** (Relationship counting and analysis)
5. **#1777 - Product's Price for Each Store** (Missing data analysis patterns)

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **Missing Data Detection**: Use LEFT JOIN with NULL check or NOT EXISTS
2. **Multiple Conditions**: Combine salary filter with missing manager condition
3. **NULL Handling**: Distinguish between NULL manager_id and missing manager records
4. **Referential Integrity**: Detect broken foreign key relationships

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Explain missing data logic**: "Manager left means their record deleted but references remain"
2. **Discuss multiple conditions**: "Need both salary < 30000 AND manager missing"
3. **Address NULL handling**: "Exclude employees with NULL manager_id - they never had managers"
4. **Consider data quality**: "This query helps identify orphaned records needing attention"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- LEFT JOIN with NULL check for missing references
- NOT EXISTS subquery for non-matching records
- Multiple WHERE conditions with AND logic
- Referential integrity validation queries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Forgetting NULL manager_id check** (including employees who never had managers)
2. **Using INNER JOIN** (would exclude the missing managers we want to find)
3. **NOT IN with NULLs** (can cause unexpected behavior if employee_id contains NULL)
4. **Wrong condition order** (not optimizing filter sequence for performance)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- INDEX on manager_id for efficient LEFT JOIN
- INDEX on salary for fast salary filtering
- Consider filtering salary first before JOIN for better performance
- NOT EXISTS can be faster than LEFT JOIN for large datasets

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Ownership**: Take responsibility for employees who lost management structure
- **Customer Obsession**: Ensure employee well-being to maintain customer service quality
- **Bias for Action**: Quickly identify and address organizational gaps
- **Deliver Results**: Maintain organizational effectiveness through proper management structure

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Find all orphaned employees regardless of salary**
2. **Calculate average salary of orphaned vs non-orphaned employees**
3. **Find managers who have orphaned employees reporting to them**
4. **List employees whose manager earns less than them**

Remember: Organizational health monitoring like this is crucial for Amazon's massive workforce management, ensuring no employee falls through the cracks when managers leave or organizational changes occur!
