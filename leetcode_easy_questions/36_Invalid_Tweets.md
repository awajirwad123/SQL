# LeetCode Easy #1683: Invalid Tweets

## 📋 Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. A tweet is **invalid** if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is **strictly greater than 15**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## 🗄️ Table Schema

**Tweets Table:**
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
```
- tweet_id is the primary key for this table.
- This table contains all the tweets in a social media app.

## 📊 Sample Data

**Tweets Table:**
| tweet_id | content                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 1        | Vote for Biden                   |
| 2        | Let us make America great again! |

**Expected Output:**
| tweet_id |
|----------|
| 2        |

**Explanation:**
- Tweet 1 has length = 14, which is not strictly greater than 15.
- Tweet 2 has length = 32, which is strictly greater than 15.

## 🤔 Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Need to filter tweets based on content length
- Character count must be strictly greater than 15 (> 15, not >= 15)
- Return only tweet_id for invalid tweets

### 2. **Key Insights**
- Use LENGTH() or CHAR_LENGTH() function to count characters
- Apply WHERE clause with length condition
- Simple filtering problem with string length validation

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This is a straightforward filtering problem based on string length"
- "Need to be careful about the condition: strictly greater than 15"
- "Consider different character counting methods across databases"

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Calculate Content Length
```sql
-- Count characters in content
LENGTH(content) or CHAR_LENGTH(content)
```

### Step 2: Apply Filter Condition
```sql
-- Filter for tweets with content length > 15
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15
```

### Step 3: Select Required Columns
```sql
-- Return only tweet_id for invalid tweets
SELECT tweet_id
```

## ✅ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Using LENGTH Function**
```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using CHAR_LENGTH Function (Better for Unicode)**
```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

**Solution 3: Using LEN Function (SQL Server)**
```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LEN(content) > 15;
```

**Solution 4: With Content Length Display**
```sql
SELECT 
    tweet_id,
    content,
    LENGTH(content) as content_length
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

**Solution 5: Comprehensive Tweet Content Analysis System**

## 🔗 Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#1667 - Fix Names in a Table** (String manipulation and validation)
2. **#1729 - Find Followers Count** (Basic aggregation and counting)
3. **#1484 - Group Sold Products By The Date** (String aggregation functions)
4. **#1873 - Calculate Special Bonus** (Conditional operations based on content)
5. **#1795 - Rearrange Products Table** (Data validation and transformation)

## 📚 Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### 💡 **Core Concepts**
1. **String Length Functions**: LENGTH(), CHAR_LENGTH(), LEN()
2. **Comparison Operators**: Greater than (>) for strict comparison
3. **Simple Filtering**: WHERE clause with basic conditions
4. **Result Selection**: SELECT specific columns based on requirements

### 🚀 **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Clarify requirements**: "Confirm if it's strictly greater than 15, not greater than or equal to"
2. **Discuss function differences**: "LENGTH vs CHAR_LENGTH for Unicode characters"
3. **Consider edge cases**: "Empty strings, null values, special characters"
4. **Performance implications**: "Simple length check is very efficient"

### 🔧 **Common Patterns**
- Simple WHERE clause filtering
- String length validation
- Result set filtering based on computed values
- Basic data quality checks

### ⚠️ **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Wrong comparison operator** (>= instead of >)
2. **Database-specific functions** (LENGTH vs LEN vs CHAR_LENGTH)
3. **Null handling** (LENGTH of NULL returns NULL)
4. **Unicode considerations** (multibyte characters)

### 🔍 **Performance Considerations**
- LENGTH function is very fast and well-optimized
- No need for complex indexing for this simple operation
- Consider functional indexes if this becomes a frequent filter
- Minimal resource usage for this type of validation

### 🎯 **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Customer Obsession**: Content quality standards improve user experience
- **Operational Excellence**: Automated content validation ensures platform reliability
- **Innovation**: Advanced content moderation systems enable scalable community management
- **Bias for Action**: Quick content validation prevents poor user experiences

## 🔄 Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Find tweets with specific character count ranges**
2. **Calculate average content length by user type**
3. **Find tweets that exceed limits by different amounts**
4. **Implement content validation with multiple criteria**

Remember: Content validation is essential for Amazon's social platforms, customer review systems, product descriptions, and any user-generated content across Amazon's ecosystem!
