# LeetCode Easy #610: Triangle Judgement

## üìã Problem Statement

A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could form a triangle.

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.

Could you help Tim by writing a SQL query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle?

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Triangle Table:**
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
```
- Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.

## üìä Sample Data

**Triangle Table:**
| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |

**Expected Output:**
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

**Explanation:**
- For (13, 15, 30): 13 + 15 = 28 < 30, so it cannot form a triangle
- For (10, 20, 15): All combinations satisfy the triangle inequality (10+20>15, 10+15>20, 20+15>10)

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Need to apply triangle inequality theorem
- For three sides a, b, c to form a triangle: a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a
- All three conditions must be satisfied
- Use CASE statement to return "Yes" or "No"

### 2. **Key Mathematical Insight**
- Triangle Inequality: Sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side
- Need to check all three combinations
- If ANY condition fails, it's not a triangle

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This is a mathematical validation problem using triangle inequality"
- "I need to check all three combinations of side sums"
- "CASE statement is perfect for conditional logic like this"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Understand Triangle Inequality
```sql
-- For sides x, y, z to form a triangle:
-- x + y > z  AND  x + z > y  AND  y + z > x
```

### Step 2: Apply Conditional Logic
```sql
-- Use CASE WHEN to check all three conditions
-- Return "Yes" if all conditions are true, "No" otherwise
```

### Step 3: Format Output
```sql
-- Select all original columns plus the triangle judgment
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: CASE Statement with AND Logic**
```sql
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END as triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using Boolean Logic**
```sql
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z,
    IF(x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x, 'Yes', 'No') as triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

**Solution 3: Explicit Condition Check**
```sql
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z,
    CASE 
        WHEN (x + y <= z) OR (x + z <= y) OR (y + z <= x) THEN 'No'
        ELSE 'Yes'
    END as triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

**Solution 4: With Mathematical Validation**
```sql
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z,
    x + y as sum_xy,
    x + z as sum_xz,
    y + z as sum_yz,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END as triangle,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Valid Triangle'
        WHEN x + y <= z THEN 'x + y <= z'
        WHEN x + z <= y THEN 'x + z <= y'
        WHEN y + z <= x THEN 'y + z <= x'
    END as failure_reason
FROM Triangle;
```

**Solution 5: Using Greatest/Least Functions**
```sql
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z,
    CASE 
        WHEN GREATEST(x, y, z) < (x + y + z - GREATEST(x, y, z)) THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END as triangle
FROM Triangle;
```
