# LeetCode Easy #1661: Average Time of Process per Machine

## üìã Problem Statement

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the **same number of processes**. Write a SQL query to find the **average time** each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the **'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp**. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the **machine_id** along with the **average time** as **processing_time**, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Activity Table:**
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
```
- The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
- (machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table.
- machine_id is the ID of a machine.
- process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
- activity_type is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end').
- timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.

## üìä Sample Data

**Activity Table:**
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |

**Expected Output:**
| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

**Explanation:**
- **Machine 0**: 
  - Process 0: 1.520 - 0.712 = 0.808 seconds
  - Process 1: 4.120 - 3.140 = 0.980 seconds
  - Average: (0.808 + 0.980) / 2 = 0.894 seconds
- **Machine 1**:
  - Process 0: 1.550 - 0.550 = 1.000 seconds
  - Process 1: 1.420 - 0.430 = 0.990 seconds
  - Average: (1.000 + 0.990) / 2 = 0.995 seconds
- **Machine 2**:
  - Process 0: 4.512 - 4.100 = 0.412 seconds
  - Process 1: 5.000 - 2.500 = 2.500 seconds
  - Average: (0.412 + 2.500) / 2 = 1.456 seconds

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Each process has both 'start' and 'end' activities
- Need to calculate duration for each process (end - start)
- Then average all process durations per machine
- Round result to 3 decimal places

### 2. **Key Insights**
- Self-join Activity table on machine_id and process_id
- Join start activities with end activities
- Calculate difference between end and start timestamps
- GROUP BY machine_id and use AVG() function

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This requires pairing start and end events for each process"
- "Self-join is needed to match start with corresponding end"
- "AVG() will calculate mean processing time per machine"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Identify Start and End Activities
```sql
-- Split into start and end activities
SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp FROM Activity WHERE activity_type = 'start'
SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp FROM Activity WHERE activity_type = 'end'
```

### Step 2: Join Start with End
```sql
-- Join on machine_id and process_id
FROM Activity start_act
JOIN Activity end_act 
  ON start_act.machine_id = end_act.machine_id 
  AND start_act.process_id = end_act.process_id
WHERE start_act.activity_type = 'start' 
  AND end_act.activity_type = 'end'
```

### Step 3: Calculate Process Duration
```sql
-- Calculate duration for each process
end_act.timestamp - start_act.timestamp as process_duration
```

### Step 4: Average by Machine and Round
```sql
-- Group by machine and calculate average
GROUP BY machine_id
ROUND(AVG(process_duration), 3) as processing_time
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Self-Join Approach**
```sql
SELECT 
    a1.machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2 
  ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id 
  AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
  AND a1.activity_type = 'start' 
  AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a1.machine_id;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using Conditional Aggregation**
```sql
SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(
        (SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) - 
         SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END)) / 
        COUNT(DISTINCT process_id), 
        3
    ) as processing_time
FROM Activity
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

**Solution 3: Using Window Functions**
```sql
WITH process_durations AS (
    SELECT 
        machine_id,
        process_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp 
                 WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN -timestamp 
                 ELSE 0 END) as duration
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
)
SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(duration), 3) as processing_time
FROM process_durations
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

**Solution 4: Using Subquery Approach**
```sql
SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(process_time), 3) as processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT 
        machine_id,
        process_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) -
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) as process_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) process_calculations

## üîó Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#1633 - Percentage of Users Attended a Contest** (Percentage calculations with aggregation)
2. **#1251 - Average Selling Price** (Weighted averages with date ranges)
3. **#1280 - Students and Examinations** (CROSS JOIN with aggregation)
4. **#1484 - Group Sold Products By The Date** (GROUP BY with aggregation functions)
5. **#1607 - Sellers With No Sales** (Performance analysis with time filtering)

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **Self-Join**: Matching start and end events for the same process
2. **Time Calculations**: Subtracting timestamps to get duration
3. **Aggregation**: AVG() function for calculating averages
4. **Precision**: ROUND() function for exact decimal places

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Explain self-join logic**: "Join table with itself to match start and end activities"
2. **Discuss time calculation**: "End timestamp minus start timestamp gives process duration"
3. **Address precision**: "ROUND(value, 3) ensures exactly 3 decimal places"
4. **Consider alternatives**: "Could use conditional aggregation instead of self-join"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- Self-join on multiple conditions (machine_id, process_id, activity_type)
- Time duration calculation (end_time - start_time)
- GROUP BY with aggregation functions
- ROUND for decimal precision control

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Wrong join conditions** (not matching activity_type correctly)
2. **Missing GROUP BY** (returning individual processes instead of averages)
3. **Incorrect precision** (wrong number of decimal places)
4. **Performance issues** (missing indexes on join columns)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- INDEX on (machine_id, process_id, activity_type) for efficient joins
- Self-joins can be expensive on large datasets
- Consider conditional aggregation for better performance
- ROUND function has minimal performance impact

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Operational Excellence**: Systematic measurement and optimization of manufacturing processes
- **Innovation**: Advanced analytics drive smart factory and Industry 4.0 capabilities
- **Customer Obsession**: Manufacturing efficiency improvements reduce costs and improve quality
- **Deliver Results**: Data-driven insights enable continuous performance improvement
