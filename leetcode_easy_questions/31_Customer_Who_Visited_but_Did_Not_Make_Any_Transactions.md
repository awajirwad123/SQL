# LeetCode Easy #1581: Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in **any order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Visits Table:**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```
- visit_id is the primary key for this table.
- This table contains information about the visits of the customers.

**Transactions Table:**
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
```
- transaction_id is the primary key for this table.
- visit_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Visits table.
- This table contains information about the transactions made during the visits.

## üìä Sample Data

**Visits Table:**
| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

**Transactions Table:**
| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |

**Expected Output:**
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

**Explanation:**
- **Customer 23**: Made 1 visit (visit_id=1) ‚úÖ Had transaction (transaction_id=12) ‚Üí Not included
- **Customer 9**: Made 1 visit (visit_id=2) ‚úÖ Had transaction (transaction_id=13) ‚Üí Not included
- **Customer 30**: Made 1 visit (visit_id=4) ‚ùå No transactions ‚Üí Included (count=1)
- **Customer 54**: Made 3 visits (visit_id=5,7,8) ‚úÖ Had transactions only for visit_id=5 ‚Üí 2 visits without transactions
- **Customer 96**: Made 1 visit (visit_id=6) ‚ùå No transactions ‚Üí Included (count=1)

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Find customers who visited but didn't make transactions
- Count how many such visits each customer made
- Need to identify visits without corresponding transactions
- Use LEFT JOIN to find visits without transactions

### 2. **Key Insights**
- LEFT JOIN Visits with Transactions on visit_id
- Where Transactions.visit_id IS NULL indicates no transaction
- GROUP BY customer_id to count visits per customer
- COUNT(*) gives number of visits without transactions

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This is a classic LEFT JOIN with NULL filtering problem"
- "Need to count visits per customer where no transaction occurred"
- "LEFT JOIN preserves all visits, NULL indicates missing transactions"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Join Tables
```sql
-- LEFT JOIN to keep all visits
-- Even those without transactions
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
```

### Step 2: Filter Non-Transaction Visits
```sql
-- WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
-- Identifies visits without transactions
```

### Step 3: Group and Count
```sql
-- GROUP BY customer_id
-- COUNT(*) for visits per customer
```

### Step 4: Select Results
```sql
-- customer_id and count of visits without transactions
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as count_no_trans
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: LEFT JOIN with NULL Filtering**
```sql
SELECT 
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: Using NOT EXISTS**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Transactions t 
    WHERE t.visit_id = v.visit_id
)
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Solution 3: Using NOT IN (with NULL handling)**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits
WHERE visit_id NOT IN (
    SELECT visit_id 
    FROM Transactions 
    WHERE visit_id IS NOT NULL
)
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Solution 4: Using EXCEPT/MINUS (PostgreSQL/Oracle)**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL version
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits
WHERE visit_id IN (
    SELECT visit_id FROM Visits
    EXCEPT
    SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions
)
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Solution 5: Comprehensive Analysis with Visit Details**
```sql
SELECT 
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as count_no_trans,
    GROUP_CONCAT(v.visit_id ORDER BY v.visit_id) as visits_without_transactions,
    
    -- Additional analytics
    COUNT(DISTINCT v.visit_id) as total_visits_no_trans,
    
    -- Visit pattern analysis
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 1 THEN 'Single Non-Transaction Visit'
        WHEN COUNT(*) <= 3 THEN 'Few Non-Transaction Visits'
        WHEN COUNT(*) <= 5 THEN 'Multiple Non-Transaction Visits'
        ELSE 'Frequent Non-Transaction Visits'
    END as visit_pattern,
    
    -- Customer behavior insight
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) >= 3 THEN 'High Browse Behavior'
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 2 THEN 'Moderate Browse Behavior'
        ELSE 'Low Browse Behavior'
    END as customer_behavior_type
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id
ORDER BY count_no_trans DESC, v.customer_id;
```

## üîó Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#1378 - Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier** (LEFT JOIN patterns)
2. **#1280 - Students and Examinations** (CROSS JOIN with LEFT JOIN)
3. **#1607 - Sellers With No Sales** (LEFT JOIN with NULL filtering)
4. **#1965 - Employees With Missing Information** (LEFT JOIN for missing data)
5. **#1795 - Rearrange Products Table** (Data transformation with JOINs)

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **LEFT JOIN**: Preserves all records from the left table
2. **NULL Filtering**: WHERE condition to find missing relationships
3. **Aggregation**: COUNT() to summarize missing relationships
4. **GROUP BY**: Organizing results by key dimensions

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Explain JOIN types**: "LEFT JOIN keeps all visits, even without transactions"
2. **Clarify NULL logic**: "WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL finds visits without transactions"
3. **Discuss alternatives**: "Could also use NOT EXISTS or NOT IN"
4. **Consider performance**: "LEFT JOIN with NULL filter is generally efficient"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- LEFT JOIN for preserving all records from primary table
- IS NULL condition to identify missing relationships
- GROUP BY to aggregate missing relationship counts
- Alternative approaches with NOT EXISTS or NOT IN

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Using INNER JOIN** (would exclude visits without transactions)
2. **Forgetting GROUP BY** (would return individual visits, not counts)
3. **NOT IN with NULLs** (can return unexpected results with NULL values)
4. **Wrong NULL condition** (using = NULL instead of IS NULL)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- LEFT JOIN is generally efficient with proper indexing
- INDEX on join columns (visit_id) improves performance
- NOT EXISTS can be faster than NOT IN for large datasets
- Consider query plan analysis for optimization

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Customer Obsession**: Understanding customer browsing behavior improves experience
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Analytics on non-converting visits guide optimization strategies
- **Operational Excellence**: Systematic identification of conversion opportunities
- **Innovation**: Advanced analytics enable personalized intervention strategies

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Find customers who visited multiple times but never bought**
2. **Calculate average time between visits for non-purchasing customers**
3. **Identify products viewed but never purchased**
4. **Find customer segments with highest browse-to-purchase ratios**

Remember: Browse-without-purchase analysis is essential for Amazon's conversion optimization, customer retention strategies, personalization systems, and revenue maximization across all e-commerce and digital service platforms!
