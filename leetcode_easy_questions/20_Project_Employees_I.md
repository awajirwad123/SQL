# LeetCode Easy #1075: Project Employees I

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query that reports the **average experience years** of all the employees for each project, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Project Table:**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```
- `(project_id, employee_id)` is the primary key of this table.
- Each row of this table indicates that the employee with `employee_id` is working on the project with `project_id`.

**Employee Table:**
```
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
```
- `employee_id` is the primary key of this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about one employee.

## üìä Sample Data

**Project Table:**
| project_id | employee_id |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | 1           |
| 1          | 2           |
| 1          | 3           |
| 2          | 1           |
| 2          | 4           |

**Employee Table:**
| employee_id | name  | experience_years |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| 1           | Khaled| 3                |
| 2           | Ali   | 2                |
| 3           | John  | 1                |
| 4           | Doe   | 2                |

**Expected Output:**
| project_id | average_years |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 2.00          |
| 2          | 2.50          |

**Explanation:** 
- Project 1: Employees 1(3 years), 2(2 years), 3(1 year) ‚Üí Average = (3+2+1)/3 = 2.00
- Project 2: Employees 1(3 years), 4(2 years) ‚Üí Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.50

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Need to join Project and Employee tables
- Calculate average experience per project
- GROUP BY project_id and use AVG function
- Round result to 2 decimal places

### 2. **Key Insights**
- Project table links employees to projects
- Employee table contains experience data
- JOIN on employee_id to get experience for each project
- GROUP BY project_id to calculate per-project averages

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This is a JOIN with aggregation problem"
- "I need to group by project and average the experience years"
- "ROUND function ensures 2 decimal places in output"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Join Tables
```sql
-- JOIN Project and Employee on employee_id
-- This connects project assignments to employee experience
```

### Step 2: Group by Project
```sql
-- GROUP BY project_id to aggregate per project
-- This creates groups for each project
```

### Step 3: Calculate Average and Round
```sql
-- AVG(experience_years) for average experience
-- ROUND(..., 2) for 2 decimal places
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Basic JOIN with AVG**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) as average_years
FROM Project p
INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: With Explicit Casting**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(e.experience_years AS DECIMAL)), 2) as average_years
FROM Project p
INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```

**Solution 3: With Additional Project Statistics**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    COUNT(*) as team_size,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) as average_years,
    MIN(e.experience_years) as min_experience,
    MAX(e.experience_years) as max_experience
FROM Project p
INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```

**Solution 4: Using Window Functions**
```sql
WITH project_experience AS (
    SELECT 
        p.project_id,
        e.experience_years,
        AVG(e.experience_years) OVER (PARTITION BY p.project_id) as avg_exp
    FROM Project p
    INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT DISTINCT 
    project_id,
    ROUND(avg_exp, 2) as average_years
FROM project_experience;
```

**Solution 5: With Team Experience Distribution**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) as average_years,
    ROUND(STDDEV(e.experience_years), 2) as experience_std_dev,
    CASE 
        WHEN STDDEV(e.experience_years) <= 1 THEN 'Homogeneous Team'
        WHEN STDDEV(e.experience_years) <= 2 THEN 'Balanced Team'
        ELSE 'Diverse Team'
    END as team_composition
FROM Project p
INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```
