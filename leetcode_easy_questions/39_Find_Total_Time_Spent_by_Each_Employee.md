# LeetCode Easy #1741: Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to calculate the **total time** in minutes spent by each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is **out_time - in_time**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Employees Table:**
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
```
- (emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key of this table.
- The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
- event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
- in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
- It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.

## üìä Sample Data

**Employees Table:**
| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |

**Expected Output:**
| day        | emp_id | total_time |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |

**Explanation:**
- Employee 1 on 2020-11-28: (32-4) + (200-55) = 28 + 145 = 173 minutes
- Employee 2 on 2020-11-28: (33-3) = 30 minutes
- Employee 1 on 2020-12-03: (42-1) = 41 minutes
- Employee 2 on 2020-12-09: (74-47) = 27 minutes

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Calculate time spent for each employee entry/exit session
- Sum all time periods for each employee on each day
- Handle multiple entries/exits per day per employee
- Time calculation: out_time - in_time

### 2. **Key Insights**
- GROUP BY employee and day to aggregate multiple sessions
- SUM(out_time - in_time) calculates total daily time
- Each row represents one work session
- Need to aggregate across all sessions per employee per day

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "Each row is one work session, need to sum all sessions per employee per day"
- "out_time - in_time gives session duration, SUM aggregates daily total"
- "GROUP BY emp_id and event_day handles multiple entries per day"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Calculate Session Duration
```sql
-- Calculate time spent in each session
out_time - in_time as session_duration
```

### Step 2: Group by Employee and Day
```sql
-- Group to aggregate multiple sessions per employee per day
GROUP BY emp_id, event_day
```

### Step 3: Sum All Sessions per Day
```sql
-- Sum all session durations for each employee per day
SUM(out_time - in_time) as total_time
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Basic Aggregation**
```sql
SELECT 
    event_day as day,
    emp_id,
    SUM(out_time - in_time) as total_time
FROM Employees
GROUP BY emp_id, event_day;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: With Detailed Session Information**
```sql
SELECT 
    event_day as day,
    emp_id,
    COUNT(*) as sessions_count,
    SUM(out_time - in_time) as total_time,
    AVG(out_time - in_time) as avg_session_time
FROM Employees
GROUP BY emp_id, event_day
ORDER BY event_day, emp_id;
```

**Solution 3: Using Subquery for Clarity**
```sql
SELECT 
    day,
    emp_id,
    SUM(session_time) as total_time
FROM (
    SELECT 
        event_day as day,
        emp_id,
        out_time - in_time as session_time
    FROM Employees
) session_data
GROUP BY emp_id, day;
```

**Solution 4: With Time Range Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    event_day as day,
    emp_id,
    SUM(out_time - in_time) as total_time,
    MIN(in_time) as first_entry,
    MAX(out_time) as last_exit,
    MAX(out_time) - MIN(in_time) as office_span
FROM Employees
GROUP BY emp_id, event_day
ORDER BY event_day, emp_id;
```

3. **SUM Function**: Aggregate multiple sessions per employee per day
4. **Multiple Sessions**: Handle employees with multiple entries/exits per day

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Explain time calculation**: "Each row is one session, subtract in_time from out_time"
2. **Discuss aggregation**: "GROUP BY emp_id and event_day sums all sessions per employee per day"
3. **Address business logic**: "Employees can enter/exit multiple times, need to sum all sessions"
4. **Consider data integrity**: "Guaranteed no overlapping sessions and in_time < out_time"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- Time difference calculation (out_time - in_time)
- GROUP BY multiple columns for multi-dimensional aggregation
- SUM for accumulating session durations
- Multi-session handling within single day

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Forgetting GROUP BY** (would calculate individual sessions, not daily totals)
2. **Wrong grouping columns** (missing event_day would sum across all days)
3. **Time unit confusion** (assuming hours vs minutes)
4. **Not handling multiple sessions** (showing each session instead of daily total)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- INDEX on (emp_id, event_day) for efficient grouping
- Consider partitioning by date for large time-series data
- SUM operations are fast with proper indexing
- Time arithmetic is computationally efficient

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Operational Excellence**: Accurate workforce analytics enable efficient operations management
- **Customer Obsession**: Understanding work patterns helps optimize customer service delivery
- **Ownership**: Comprehensive time tracking enables accountability and performance management
- **Deliver Results**: Workforce optimization drives productivity and business outcomes

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Calculate average daily work hours per employee**
2. **Find employees working overtime (>8 hours) and calculate overtime hours**
3. **Identify peak office hours by counting overlapping sessions**
4. **Calculate total break time between sessions for each employee**

Remember: Workforce time analytics are essential for Amazon's operations across fulfillment centers, customer service, corporate offices, and ensuring compliance with labor regulations globally!
