# LeetCode Easy #1378: Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

## üìã Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to show the **unique ID** of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace it with **null**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

**Employees Table:**
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```
- id is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.

**EmployeeUNI Table:**
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```
- (id, unique_id) is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.

## üìä Sample Data

**Employees Table:**
| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |

**EmployeeUNI Table:**
| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |

**Expected Output:**
| unique_id | name    |
|-----------|---------|
| null      | Alice   |
| null      | Bob     |
| 2         | Meir    |
| 3         | Winston |

**Explanation:**
- Alice (id=1) and Bob (id=7) have no corresponding unique_id, so they get null
- Meir (id=11) has unique_id=2
- Winston (id=90) has unique_id=3
- Employee with id=3 in EmployeeUNI has no corresponding employee record (ignored)

## ü§î Interview Thought Process

### 1. **Problem Analysis**
- Need to include all employees, even those without unique IDs
- Replace missing unique IDs with NULL
- LEFT JOIN preserves all employees
- Some unique IDs may not have corresponding employees

### 2. **Key Insights**
- LEFT JOIN to preserve all employee records
- NULL values appear automatically for non-matching records
- Only employees should appear in results, not orphaned unique IDs
- Simple two-table join operation

### 3. **Interview Discussion Points**
- "This is a classic LEFT JOIN scenario"
- "We want to preserve all employees regardless of unique ID existence"
- "NULL handling is automatic with LEFT JOIN"

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Logic

### Step 1: Identify Base Table
```sql
-- Employees is the base table (we want all employees)
-- Use LEFT JOIN to preserve all employee records
```

### Step 2: Join with Unique IDs
```sql
-- LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI ON matching id
-- Non-matching employees will have NULL unique_id
```

### Step 3: Select Required Columns
```sql
-- SELECT unique_id (or NULL), name
-- Order doesn't matter per problem statement
```

## ‚úÖ Optimized SQL Solution

**Solution 1: Basic LEFT JOIN**
```sql
SELECT 
    eu.unique_id,
    e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id;
```

### Alternative Solutions

**Solution 2: With Explicit NULL Handling**
```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(eu.unique_id, NULL) as unique_id,
    e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id;
```

**Solution 3: Using CASE Statement**
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN eu.unique_id IS NOT NULL THEN eu.unique_id 
        ELSE NULL 
    END as unique_id,
    e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id;
```

**Solution 4: With Additional Employee Information**
```sql
SELECT 
    e.id as employee_id,
    e.name,
    eu.unique_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN eu.unique_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has Unique ID'
        ELSE 'Missing Unique ID'
    END as id_status
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id;
```

**Solution 5: Comprehensive Employee Directory**
```sql
WITH employee_status AS (
    SELECT 
        e.id as employee_id,
        e.name,
        eu.unique_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN eu.unique_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Active'
            ELSE 'Pending ID Assignment'
        END as status,
        CASE 
            WHEN eu.unique_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END as has_unique_id_flag
    FROM Employees e
    LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id
)
SELECT 
    unique_id,
    name,
    status,
    employee_id
FROM employee_status
ORDER BY 
    has_unique_id_flag DESC,  -- Show employees with unique IDs first
    name;
```

## üîó Related LeetCode Questions

1. **#175 - Combine Two Tables** (Basic LEFT JOIN)
2. **#181 - Employees Earning More Than Their Managers** (Self JOIN)
3. **#183 - Customers Who Never Placed an Order** (LEFT JOIN with NULL)
4. **#577 - Employee Bonus** (LEFT JOIN with aggregation)
5. **#1068 - Product Sales Analysis I** (INNER JOIN operations)

## üìö Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### üí° **Core Concepts**
1. **LEFT JOIN**: Preserving all records from the left table
2. **NULL Handling**: Automatic NULL for non-matching records
3. **Primary vs Foreign Keys**: Understanding table relationships
4. **Data Preservation**: Keeping all employees regardless of unique ID

### üöÄ **Amazon Interview Tips**
1. **Clarify requirements**: "Should I include all employees even without unique IDs?"
2. **Explain JOIN choice**: "LEFT JOIN preserves all employee records"
3. **Handle edge cases**: "What about employees with multiple unique IDs?"
4. **Business context**: "This supports employee directory and access management"

### üîß **Common Patterns**
- LEFT JOIN for optional relationships
- NULL handling in JOIN results
- Primary table preservation
- Optional attribute mapping

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Using INNER JOIN** (loses employees without unique IDs)
2. **Wrong table order** (putting EmployeeUNI as base table)
3. **Unnecessary NULL handling** (COALESCE when not needed)
4. **Missing edge cases** (not considering orphaned unique IDs)

### üîç **Performance Considerations**
- Index on id columns for efficient joins
- Consider covering indexes for frequently queried columns
- Monitor for orphaned records in lookup tables
- Use EXPLAIN PLAN to verify join strategy

### üéØ **Amazon Leadership Principles Applied**
- **Security First**: Proper identity management for access control
- **Operational Excellence**: Complete employee directory maintenance
- **Customer Obsession**: Reliable employee information for internal customers
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Comprehensive identity analytics for HR planning

## üîÑ Practice Variations

Try solving these variations to master the concept:

1. **Find employees with multiple unique IDs**
2. **Include employee count per unique ID**
3. **Show orphaned unique IDs**
4. **Add employee status and department information**

Remember: Identity management is fundamental to Amazon's employee systems, access control, security frameworks, and organizational analytics across global operations and diverse workforce management needs!
