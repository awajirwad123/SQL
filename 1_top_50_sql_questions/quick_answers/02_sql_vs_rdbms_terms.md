# 2. SQL vs RDBMS Terms

Q: What is SQL?
A: A declarative language to define, query, and manipulate relational data.

Q: What is an RDBMS?
A: The software engine implementing SQL + storage + optimization (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Q: Database vs schema?
A: Database: top-level container (catalog). Schema: namespace grouping objects inside a database.

Q: Table?
A: Structured set of rows (tuples) with named, typed columns.

Q: Is "schema" only a namespace?
A: Also refers to the logical design (entities/relationships) contextually.

Q: MySQL quirk?
A: "Database" effectively serves as the schema namespace; fewer nested levels.
